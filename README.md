# Forest_fire_burned_area_prediction
Forest Fires can be very dangerous and harmful. The significantly bad effects of large-scale
forest fires include but are not limited to: killing or harming human and wild animals, destroying
housing and other constructions, eliminating wildlife habitats, as well as releasing a lot of
greenhouse gases (e.g. Carbon Dioxide) into the environment. However, for the majority of
times, forest fires cannot be completely prevented due to the climate and weather conditions, so
monitoring the burned area of forest fires and detecting any large-scale forest fires are very
critical. The traditional method to detect and monitor forest fires is based on installing local
sensors, which can be very costly and inefficient. Our objective is to build an accurate
machine learning model to predict the size of the burned area of a forest fire, to monitor the
scale. The model is based on an open-access dataset collected in Montesinho natural park,
Portugal. The methods of building the model includes multiple regression, SVR, ANN
regression, KNN and Naive bayes classification. With the ML model, the forest fires can be
efficiently detected and monitored in real-time, which will potentially avoid corresponding
property loss, make better allocation of resources and prevent environmental damages.
